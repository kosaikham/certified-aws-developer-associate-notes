# EBS Volume

* An EC2 machine loses its root volume (main drive) when it is manually terminated.
* Unexpected terminations might happen from time to time (AWS would email you)
* Sometimes, you need a way to store your instance data somewhere
* An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
* It allows your instances to persist data

#### EBS Volume
* It’s a network drive (Not a physical drive)
    * It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency
    * It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
* It’s locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
    * An EBS Volume in us-east-1a cannot be attached to us-east-1b
    * To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it
* Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs and IOPs)
    * You get billed for all the provisioned capacity
    * You can increase the capacity of the drive over time

#### EBS Volume Types
- EBS Volumes come in 4 types 
- GP2 (SSD): General purpose SSD volume that balances price and performance for a wide variety of workloads 
- IO1 (SSD): Highest-performance SSD volume for mission-critical low-latency or high- throughput workloads 
- ST1 (HDD): Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, throughput- intensive workloads 
- SC1 (HDD): Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads 
- EBS Volumes are characterized in Size | Throughput | IOPS
- When in doubt always consult the AWS documentation

#### EBS Volume Resizing
* Feb 2017: You can resize your EBS Volumes
* After resizing an EBS volume, you need to repartition your drive

EBS Snapshots
* EBS Volumes can be backed up using “snapshots”
* Snapshots only take the actual space of the blocks on the volume
* If you snapshot a 100GB drive that only has 5 gb of data, then your EBS snapshot will only be 5 gb
* Snapshots are used for:
    * Backups: ensuring you can save your data in case of catastrophe
    * Volume migration
        * Resizing a volume down
        * Changing the volume type
        * Encrypt a volume

#### EBS Encryption
* When you create an encrypted EBS volume, you get the following:
    * Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume
    * All the data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is encrypted
    * All snapshots are encrypted
    * All volumes created from the snapshots are encrypted
* Encryption and decryption are handled transparently (you have nothing to do)
* Encryption has a minimal impact on latency
* EBS Encryption leverages keys from KMS (AES-256)
* Copying an unencrypted snapshot allows encryption

#### EBS vs. Instance Store
* Some instance do not come with Root EBS volumes
* Instead, they come with “instance Store”
* Instance store is physically attached to the machine
* Pros:
    * Better I/O performance
* Cons:
    * On termination, the instance store is lost
    * You can’t resize the instance store
    * Backups must be operated by the user
* Overall, EBS-backed instances should fit most applications workloads

#### EBS Summary
* EBS can be attached to only one instance at a time
* EBS are locked at the AZ level
* Migrating an EBS volume across AZ means first backing it up (snapshot), then recreating it in the other AZ
* EBS backups use IO and you shouldn’t run them while your application is handling a lot of traffic
* Root EBS Volumes of instances get terminated by default if the EC2 instance gets terminated. (You can disable that)
